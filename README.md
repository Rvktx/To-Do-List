# TODO List in Python
It's a simple CLI based To-Do List app written in python.
It stores all of the tasks in a file, but it could be easily connected to external SQL/Mongo database by changing [config.py](config.py).

### Prerequisites
I have written this in Python 3.8 so it would be ideal to use this version.
To install dependencies in your environment run:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.pip
```

## How to run

```bash
$ python todo_list.py
```
